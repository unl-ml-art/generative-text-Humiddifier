# Project 1 Generative Text

Iris/Elliot Starlin-Hintz, istarlin-hintz2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

For my generative text project, I would like to experiment with Beanie Baby poems to create a completely AI Beanie Baby. I was inspired by the “Beanie Mania” documentary where the programmer of the first Beanie Baby website also wrote all the poems for the tags. My source will be a compiled text file with all the poems of the Beanie Babys. I will only be including Beanie Baby Poems in English. With this limitation, my outcomes will hopefully more cohesive and maintain the structure of the input poems. I will also include the names of the Beanie Babys. My creative goal is to sew and craft a physical Beanie Baby based on a compelling generated name and poem.
