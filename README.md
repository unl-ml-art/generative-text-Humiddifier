# BeanAI Baby, Project 1

## Abstract

For my Generative Text Project, I used GPT 2 to generate Beanie Baby Poems using a set of data collected from critter.50megs.com. From this text I aimed to collaborate with GPT 2 to design Beanie Babies based off the generated poems. I was inspired by Lina Trivedi, who wrote the first 136 Beanie Baby Poems, and is also credited with creating the first business to consumer website for Ty in 1995. In my sample data I decided to discard the German Beanie Baby poems to keep the language consistent to English. To determine the quality of generation, the new Beanie Baby poem must have a unique poem unlike the sample data, it also must have a unique name to animal match up. This was important for me because it shows the learning capabilities of GPT 2 and allows for exploration on my end, trying to determine what the Beanie Baby would look like.
